//if theere is at least one theory in physics or maths that suit the need of a hypercube database, then, wwe can set functions
//thaat differs from low dimensional analysises. So lets add a high degree tresholld for hit points on scattering. This could be helpfull for 
//feynamn motives if the locatio   of the hit points matter. But to enhance this reshold, we can add a complex and topological function
//according to lemmas in physics that help taking into account a new set of points when we deal with high degree scattering.
//so the best will be to delete cihers. We can do it if we sample the holomorphic databases.
